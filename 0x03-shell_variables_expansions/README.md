# Shell Variables and Expansions

This repository contains shell scripts for the "Shell Variables and Expansions" project in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. Each script performs specific tasks related to shell variables, expansions, aliases, and more.

## Scripts

### 1-hello_you

This script prints "hello user" where "user" is the current Linux user. It uses the `echo` command and the `$USER` variable to display the greeting.

To run the script, make it executable first using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x 1-hello_you
